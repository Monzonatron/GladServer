# GladServer
A simple login server with SQL implementation

#About
This isn't really for general use, it was a proof of concept for the creation and use of a login server on an SQL database. Users can register using a username and password, and then login with the same credentials. The program accounts for SQL sanitation, duplicate usernames, and light input formatting.
